# Basic Math

You **DO NOT** need to be a math whiz to be an amazing programmer. A good
understanding of Discrete Structures and Logic is almost all the math you need.
Being a programmer is more of a mindset then anything else. If you have a basic
understanding of pre-algebra, then these tasks shouldn't be to difficult. If
you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.
